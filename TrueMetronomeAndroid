## 1. Information We Collect

We do **not** collect information that directly identifies you as a person (such as your name, postal address, or phone number) inside the App.

However, the App and the third-party services integrated into it may collect certain information automatically, including (but not limited to):

- Device information (device model, operating system version, language, screen resolution)
- IP address and approximate location (country/region)
- Mobile advertising identifiers (such as Google Advertising ID)
- App usage data (which screens are visited, session duration, crash reports)
- Information about ads (number of ad impressions, clicks, etc.)

This information is generally collected in anonymized or pseudonymized form and is used for analytics and advertising purposes, as described below.

These services may use cookies, mobile advertising identifiers, and similar technologies to:
